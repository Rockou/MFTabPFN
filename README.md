# MFTabPFN
Multi-fidelity tabular prior-data fitted network model

This repository contains the code for MFTabPFN, designed to address accurate prediction and uncertainty quantification for applications using single- or multi-fidelity data. The corresponding datasets for this repository are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16777637.

# Environment and Dependencies
Due to parameter fine-tuning requirements of MFTabPFN, one or more GPUs are required to achieve efficient code execution.

To install MFTabPFN, clone the repository along with its associated datasets and install the required dependencies, including TabPFN, PyTorch, standard machine learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn), and other supporting libraries. After installing the dependencies, replace the default TabPFN_model.m file generated by the TabPFN library in the working environment with the modified version provided in this repository. The default TabPFN_model.m does not support direct output of variance information, whereas the modified version enables the model to produce variance estimates, which are critical for quantifying prediction uncertainty in subsequent analyses.
